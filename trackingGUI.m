function varargout = trackingGUI(varargin)
% TRACKINGGUI MATLAB code for trackingGUI.fig
%      TRACKINGGUI, by itself, creates a new TRACKINGGUI or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = TRACKINGGUI returns the handle to a new TRACKINGGUI or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      TRACKINGGUI('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in TRACKINGGUI.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      TRACKINGGUI('Property','Value',...) creates a new TRACKINGGUI or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before trackingGUI_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to trackingGUI_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
